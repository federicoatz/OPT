<p>
    In this phase, each participant will be assigned a maze of 52 standard poker cards. Given his/her maze, for each participant, an experimenter will randomly select a subset of 21 unobserved cards. 
<br>    
For simplicity, let us refer to this subset of cards with the word the “sample.” You will be asked to choose a card. 
<br>    
At the end of the experiment, if this phase is selected, you will paid 1.00 euro for each card in your sample reporting the same color (black or red) of that you have just selected.
    <br>
Moreover, you are asked to guess the number of cards in your sample reporting the same color (black or red) of that you have just selected. If your conjecture is correct, you will receive an additional amount of 10.00 euro.
